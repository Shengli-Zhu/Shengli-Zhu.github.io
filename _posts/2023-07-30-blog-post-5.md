From July 24 to 30, 2023, Liu Zhaofei, Cheng Yu, and Zhu Shengli, members of the second Qinghai-Tibet Scientific Expedition sub-project "Fundamental Investigation and Comprehensive Assessment of the Carrying Capacity of Water Resources in the South-Asia Channel," conducted a seven-day scientific expedition in the source region of the Yellow River in Qinghai, China. The expedition unfolded as follows:

---

- **July 24:** The team flew from Beijing to Xining, where they purchased sampling materials and equipment for fieldwork. They also organized and installed field instruments, performing thorough checks and adjustments to ensure proper functionality.
  
- **July 25:** The team rented a vehicle in Xining and drove to Madoi County (elevation approximately 4,300 meters). They conducted surveys of river and lake hydrological conditions in the source region of the Yellow River, covering a distance of about 700 kilometers and ascending nearly 2,000 meters.
  
- **July 26:** The team traveled from Madoi County to Zhaling Lake Township (elevation approximately 4,300 meters). At both Eling Lake and Zhaling Lake, they installed HOBO water level and temperature automatic monitoring instruments.
  
- **July 27:** The expedition continued from Zhaling Lake Township to Maduo Township (elevation approximately 4,400 meters). They conducted river flow measurements and installed water level and temperature monitoring instruments in the main stream of the Yellow River and Zhaling Lake, determining cross-sectional parameters and conducting multiple surface flow velocity measurements.
  
- **July 28:** The team focused on the area surrounding Maduo Township and the headwaters of the Yellow River (elevation approximately 4,500 meters), where they installed additional automatic monitoring instruments for rainfall and temperature.
  
- **July 29:** The team returned to Eling Lake to install more water level and temperature monitoring instruments before heading back to Xining.
  
- **July 30:** The team returned to Beijing, concluding the expedition.

Through this expedition, automatic monitoring instruments for water level, water temperature, rainfall, and air temperature were installed at the First Bridge of the Yellow River, Eling Lake, and Zhaling Lake. These collected data will provide essential support for hydrological and water resource research in the source region of the Yellow River.
