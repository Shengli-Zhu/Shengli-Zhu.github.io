From May 20 to 27, 2025, Cheng Yu and Zhu Shengli, members of the National Natural Science Foundation of China "The hydrological processes of the alpine river-lake connected basin" conducted a eight-day scientific expedition in the source region of the Yellow River in Qinghai, China.

**May 20:** The team flew from Beijing to Xining (elevation approximately 2,200 meters). After arriving, they purchased necessary materials for fieldwork, including water sample bottles and other equipment. They also conducted an initial check and calibration of the instruments.

**May 21:** The team drove approximately 500 kilometers to Maduo County (elevation around 4,300 meters), facing difficult road conditions due to rain and snow. Despite the high altitude challenges, the team prepared the instruments for hydrological surveys.

**May 22:** The team conducted hydrological surveys at the source region of the Yellow River, including the retrieval of rain gauges and data collection from automatic monitoring instruments for rainfall and temperature. They also began preparing for flow velocity measurements.

**May 23:** At the First Bridge of the Yellow River (elevation around 4,400 meters), the team measured flow velocity, collected water samples, and used differential GPS to record water surface elevation.

**May 24:** The team continued their surveys at the First Bridge of the Yellow River, collecting data on water levels and temperature from automatic instruments. They also measured the surface flow velocity at different times of the day to ensure accuracy.

**May 25:** The team traveled to Zhaling Lake and Eling Lake (elevation around 4,300 meters) to collect water samples, continuing their hydrological surveys despite the unpredictable weather conditions.

**May 26:** After returning to Xining, the team reviewed the collected data and performed maintenance on the equipment. They also made preparations to send the collected samples and instruments back to the laboratory for further analysis.

**May 27:** The team flew back to Beijing, successfully completing their eight-day expedition. Upon returning, they organized and analyzed the collected data, laying the groundwork for future research.

This expedition successfully gathered key hydrological data from the source region of the Yellow River, including information on water levels, temperature, flow velocity, and water samples. The data will play a crucial role in supporting future research on water resource management and hydrological processes in the region.
