From Into No Man's Land to Out of No Man's Land
------
During the scientific expedition along the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway on June 18, 2023, our team encountered unexpected challenges as we ventured into the uncharted wilderness of the Chang Tang Nature Reserve. This journey marked our first experience in such a remote area, where unforeseen circumstances tested our resilience and teamwork.

At 9:00 a.m., our advance team of four departed from Gêrzê County, heading towards Gumu Township along County Road 707. The journey was filled with dramatic changes in landscape and weather, from rolling hills to sudden shifts between sunshine and snowstorms, offering us the unique experience of "ten miles, different weather." As we ascended from the grasslands at 4,500 meters to the alpine meadows at 4,700 meters, the vegetation and scenery changed accordingly. Along the way, we were fortunate to observe wildlife such as Tibetan antelopes, Tibetan gazelles, Tibetan foxes, and owls.

By 1:00 p.m., we arrived in Gumu Township and consulted with the local Gangru Conservation Station about their 2023 wildlife observation records. After a brief rest, at 2:30 p.m., we joined three staff members from the station and set off in two vehicles towards the core zone to conduct field studies on Tibetan antelopes, wild yaks, and brown bears.

Around 3:50 p.m., we entered the wilderness and, after crossing several mountains, spotted a group of Tibetan antelopes on an icy plateau at an altitude of 5,300 meters. Discovering numerous wild yak droppings and a yak carcass, we decided to delve deeper in search of more traces. However, our vehicle became stuck in a marsh, and after multiple unsuccessful attempts to free it, we had no choice but to seek help from the Rongma Station.

The five of us set out on foot toward Rongma Station, enduring the harsh conditions of high-altitude trekking. After climbing several mountains, we finally discovered a small stream around 6:30 p.m., where we replenished our water supplies and continued our journey. By dusk, we reached Rongma Station, where we were warmly welcomed despite the lack of communication signals. The staff there provided us with much-needed hospitality and helped us plan our rescue mission.

At 9:00 p.m., we returned to Gangru Station in Gumu Township and requested assistance from the local police station. The officers immediately sprang into action, and we set out once more in their patrol vehicle. However, around 11:00 p.m., both our car and the police vehicle became trapped in the marshland. After several attempts, we finally managed to free both vehicles.

In the early hours of the morning, we re-entered the wilderness in search of Gangru Station's vehicle, which we successfully located and rescued at 1:24 a.m. We continued to navigate in the dark and eventually made our way back to the main road by 3:00 a.m. At the crossroads, the police officers and the driver from Gangru Station decided to return to Gumu Township, while we followed Rongma Station's vehicle to pick up the station chief and retrieve my phone.

At 3:20 a.m., we reached Rongma Station, where we found both the station chief and my phone. Despite the late hour, the staff at Rongma Station greeted us with warmth and hospitality. We then began our snowy journey back to Gumu Township. By 4:40 a.m., we finally arrived at Gangru Station, reuniting with our worried teammates.

After a brief rest, we decided to drive through the snowstorm back to Gêrzê County to rejoin the main expedition team. Exhausted, we stopped briefly to rest on the roadside around 5:00 a.m. Finally, by 8:00 a.m., we reached the outskirts of Gêrzê County, where the snow had stopped. This harrowing day had finally come to an end, and our next destination was Shiquanhe Town.

This experience was not only a significant test of our physical endurance and mental fortitude but also a challenge to our teamwork and survival skills. We gained a profound appreciation for the harsh realities and the majestic beauty of the wilderness, as well as the immense challenges and importance of scientific exploration. The road ahead remains long, but we are determined to keep moving forward.
