Daban Pass—“Closer to the Red Sun, Lower the Clouds Seem”
------
As we traversed the Daban Pass on National Highway 219, we were greeted by breathtaking scenery. The winding mountain roads, with their numerous passes, felt like gateways to heaven, perfectly embodying the sentiment of "reaching out to touch the moon, moving forward as if there were no mountains." The team was not only challenged by the harsh high-altitude environment but also deeply moved by the majestic views before us.

Desert—“Yellow Sands Rise in the South, the Sun Hides in the West”
------
The desert regions along the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway are filled with both mystery and vitality. Starting from the Red Willow Beach on the banks of the Karakashi River, the team experienced the awe-inspiring sight of endless sand dunes. At Karakul Lake, we gazed upon the towering Muztagh Ata, while the Kizil River, with its rivers and lakes, brought a touch of green life to the borderlands. These waterways not only give life to the cities of Xinjiang but also provided the expedition team with an unforgettable experience.

Border—“Born a Han Soldier, First Fought in Yan”
------
At the end of National Highways 314, 315, and 581, we reached several significant border crossings. From Khunjerab to Torugart and Irkeshtam, these ports showcased the unique landscape where "passing the border without leaving the country, crossing the border without crossing the gate." The team engaged in meaningful exchanges with the young soldiers stationed at the border, feeling their deep love and loyalty to the country. As the ancient poem suggests, today's borders are well-guarded, with the strength of a “Flying General” that no enemy can cross the Tianshan Mountains.

Through this expedition, we gained a profound understanding of Xinjiang's majestic landscapes and unique geographical environment. Whether it was the high-altitude passes, the endless deserts, or the solemn border ports, every place we visited was filled with endless exploration and inspiration.
