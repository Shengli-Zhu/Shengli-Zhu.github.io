I am excited to share that in May 2025, I successfully defended my master’s thesis and earned my degree at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. This achievement represents not only the culmination of years of hard work but also a pivotal moment in my academic career.

Under the guidance of Associate Professor Zhaofei Liu, my research focused on advancing hydrological models to improve our understanding of water-related environmental challenges. By developing and refining these models, I aimed to provide more accurate predictions and insights that could help address critical issues such as water resource management and climate change impacts.

The path to completing my master's thesis was challenging, yet each hurdle offered valuable opportunities for intellectual and professional growth. I am deeply grateful for the supervision of my advisor, as well as the unwavering support from my parents, all of whom played a pivotal role in helping me reach this milestone.

Looking forward, I am excited to continue applying the knowledge and techniques I have acquired to further research and contribute to the field of hydrology. This is just the beginning of a new chapter in my academic and professional career, and I eagerly anticipate the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me along this journey, and stay tuned for future updates on my research and ongoing projects.
