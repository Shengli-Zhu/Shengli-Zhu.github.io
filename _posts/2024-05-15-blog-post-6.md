From May 8 to 14, 2024, Cheng Yu and Zhu Shengli, members of the second Qinghai-Tibet Scientific Expedition sub-project "Fundamental Investigation and Comprehensive Assessment of the Carrying Capacity of Water Resources in the South-Asia Channel," conducted a seven-day scientific expedition in the source region of the Yellow River in Qinghai, China.

**May 8:** The team flew from Beijing to Xining (elevation approximately 2,200 meters). Upon arrival, they purchased sampling materials and equipment for fieldwork, and organized and installed field instruments, ensuring that all devices were properly checked and calibrated.

**May 9:** The team rented a vehicle in Xining and drove approximately 900 kilometers to Qumalai County in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (elevation approximately 4,400 meters), ascending about 2,200 meters. Despite experiencing symptoms of altitude sickness, the team continued preparing for the subsequent hydrological surveys of rivers and lakes.

**May 10:** The team traveled from Qumalai County to Maduo Township (elevation approximately 4,400 meters) and collected data from automatic monitoring instruments for rainfall and temperature. Due to heavy snowfall, the journey was challenging, but the team successfully retrieved data from a rain gauge at the source of the Yellow River. Given the worsening altitude sickness, some members rested while others proceeded with flow velocity measurements.

**May 11:** The team conducted hydrological observations at the First Bridge of the Yellow River (elevation approximately 4,400 meters), collecting data from water level and temperature monitoring instruments. They also measured the surface flow velocity of the Yellow River and used differential GPS to measure water surface elevation.

**May 12:** The team traveled from Maduo Township to Zhaling Lake Township (elevation approximately 4,300 meters) and continued their hydrological surveys of rivers and lakes, collecting water samples from the Yellow River and Zhaling Lake.

**May 13:** The team conducted further hydrological surveys in Maduo County (elevation approximately 4,300 meters) and attempted to collect water samples from Eling Lake. However, due to the lake’s surface remaining frozen, they were unable to do so. The team then returned to Xining.

**May 14:** The team flew back to Beijing, concluding their seven-day expedition to the source region of the Yellow River. Upon returning, they organized and analyzed the collected data, laying the groundwork for future research.

This expedition successfully gathered first-hand data on the hydrological and water resource conditions of the Yellow River’s main stream, as well as Eling Lake and Zhaling Lake. The team also maintained automatic monitoring stations equipped with water level, temperature, and rainfall instruments at key locations such as the First Bridge of the Yellow River, Eling Lake, and Zhaling Lake. These instruments provided continuous observation data from July 2023 to May 2024, capturing the major hydrological processes in the source region of the Yellow River. These valuable data will support ongoing research on hydrological and water resource management in the area.
